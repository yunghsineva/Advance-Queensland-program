## Advance-Queensland-program â€“ Data Analytics Project

This repository contains two data analytics notebooks developed as part of the **[Advance Queensland Program](https://advance.qld.gov.au/)** data analytics project. 
The goal of this project is to analyze the **performance of various government-funded programs** under the Advance Queensland Program, and to evaluate their **impact on society**, especially those with significant financial investment.
